# EDUFORD UNIVERSITY WEBSITE

It is a very simple website that I created using purely CSS (no Bootstrap) and HTML. The design is clean and the website looks good in any screen size. I copyed the idea for this website from a Youtube video, but I have made many changes and optimizations to the code myself, so that it is now clean, documented and much easier to read.

- Semantic HTML and CSS
- Implemented best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation and comments
